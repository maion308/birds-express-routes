## Instructions:

1. Create an Express server in the `server.js` file
1. Create a route handler for `GET /birds.json` that responds with a JSON representation of all birds in our application. A few hints here:
   - The information about birds exists in the file `db/birds.js` which you can access within your `server.js` file with require
   - Use [`response.json()`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.json) to send a JSON formatted response
1. Create a route handler for `GET /birds/:id.json`, where `:id` can be any number like `/birds/1.json`
   - Hint: [Express route parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters)
1. Create a `GET /` route that responds with HTML listing out the name for each bird.
1. Create a `GET /cities/:name.json` route that responds with the birds in that city, e.g. `/cities/NYC.json`
1. Create a PSQL database and Sequlize Models and connect them to you express server
